# かんばん (Kanban)

## About
This is a simple Kanban tool that is written mostly in Javascript. This
will be my first Node.JS application in the end, once I get around to the
backend system.

## Using
Currently this tool runs locally only. It requires that you use a browser
that supports CSS3 and HTML5. To use it download the latest ZIP package
from GitHub [here](https://github.com/sparticvs/kanban/archive/master.zip).
Then do the following:

    unzip master.zip

Open your browser and navigate to it on disk, or using a GUI, navigate to where
the `index.html` file is located and load it. You now have the tool running.

You can edit `js/app.js` to change the titles of the columns. Currently the
layout isn't totally responsive, so it's not recommended to go beyond the 4
columns that exist already.  You may adjust the category maximums. `-1` means
unlimited to the `js/app.js` logic.  Otherwise columns will limit.

## Anything else?
Submit bug reports on [Github](https://github.com/sparticvs/kanban/issues). Feel
